# Ozen home server

Runs the same Hebrew speech model as the phone (ivrit.ai's Whisper Turbo) on
a computer with an NVIDIA graphics card, and captions the phone's microphone
over the network. The phone can keep its own model as a fallback: once it
is downloaded (Settings → Home computer → "Download a backup to the
phone"), captions carry on from the phone by themselves when this server
can't be reached. Without it they wait, and start again within about 15
seconds of the server answering; the phone's sound alerts keep listening
meanwhile.

Measured on an RTX 2080 Ti: the first words of a line appear about a quarter
of a second behind the speaker, and the finished line is on the phone about
0.8-1 s after it was said (0.7 s of that is the quiet the server waits for
before it calls a line finished). The main README has measurements for other
cards.

## Running it on Windows

Needs an NVIDIA graphics card with at least 6 GB (8 GB or more for the
accurate finished lines), GTX 16-series / RTX 20-series or newer.

The easy way: download `Ozen-Home-Setup.cmd` from the newest release and
double-click it. It asks Windows for permission, checks the graphics card
before downloading anything (and says plainly when it isn't enough),
installs everything into `C:\ozen`, asks whether to use the computer away
from home too (Tailscale, one browser sign-in), and ends by showing the QR
code for the phone. The Start menu then has "Ozen - pair a phone" to show
the code again; it looks up the computer's address each time, so it stays
right after a new router.

By hand, in PowerShell as administrator, from this folder:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup-windows.ps1
```

`-Quiet` skips the questions (a re-run that only updates the server).

It makes a pairing code once (`C:\ozen\pairing-code`), lets the phone in
through the firewall on home networks, and registers a task that starts
the server when Windows starts, before anyone logs in, and restarts it if it
stops (also when three passes in a row fail, as after a graphics-driver
fault). With 8 GB or more it also runs the accurate model for finished
lines. Running it again updates the server and keeps the code; a computer
whose server starts at sign-in (Windows refused the before-sign-in start
the first time) keeps starting it that way without asking again. The log is
`C:\ozen\server.log`.

### When the phone can't reach it

- **Asleep.** A sleeping computer answers nothing. Setup offers to stop it
  sleeping while plugged in; by hand: Settings → System → Power → "When
  plugged in, put my device to sleep after" → Never.
- **"Public" network.** The firewall only lets the phone in on a network
  Windows calls private. Setup asks when it sees a public one (a `-Quiet`
  re-run only prints a warning); by hand: Settings → Network & internet → Wi-Fi (or
  Ethernet) → your network → Network profile type → Private network.
- **Models won't load.** `C:\ozen\server.log` says so in plain words ("could
  not load or run the speech models on the graphics card") and the server tries
  again every minute. Close games or other programs using the card, or update
  the NVIDIA driver.

### Removing it

In PowerShell as administrator:

```
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'Ozen server' -Confirm:$false
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "name='python.exe'" | Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -like '*C:\ozen\*' } | ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.ProcessId -Force }
Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName 'Ozen server'
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\ozen
```

Then delete "Ozen - pair a phone" from the Start menu, and uninstall
Tailscale from Settings → Apps if it was only there for Ozen. On the phone,
Settings → Home computer → delete the code; captions go back to the phone's
own model.

## Running it on Linux

Linux, or Windows through WSL (Ubuntu). On Windows the normal NVIDIA driver
already gives WSL the graphics card; install nothing else from NVIDIA.

```
bash setup.sh
~/ozen-server/run.sh
```

`setup.sh` installs everything into `~/ozen-server`, makes a pairing code
once (kept in `~/ozen-server/pairing-code`, readable only by you) and prints
it. Running it again updates the server and keeps the code. `bash setup.sh
--cpu` sets up a copy without a graphics card, for trying it out only.

With a graphics card of 8 GB or more, add `--final-model
ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2` to the start command (in `run.sh`, or `run.cmd`
on Windows): the fast model keeps writing the live words and the full one
writes each finished line. On a 2080 Ti that cut mistakes by about 15% with a
TV loud in the room or the speaker across it, for about 0.4 s more per
finished line.

A line in which a voice detector hears almost no voice (under 5% of it, and
less than a fifth of a second in all) is skipped before the model sees it:
kitchen clatter and a TV room hum turned into about ten invented lines a
minute, and none with the check, with no change on real speech. On 225
recordings of household sounds and noise it skipped 210; without it, the
full model wrote "toda raba" (thank you) on 139 of them. `--speech-gate 0`
turns it off.

The phone's names list goes to the model twice, as a prompt and as
hotwords, and each copy is limited to about 100 tokens (two dozen names or
so, from the top of the list): the names share the model's context with
the caption itself, and with 60 names 98 of 120 test sentences came back
cut short.

Finished lines are written with beam 5 (`--beam`), live words with beam 1: on
the 2080 Ti that cut conversation mistakes from 8.9% to 8.3% for about 0.15 s
more per finished line.

The models stay on the graphics card from the moment the server starts. On
a computer that also runs games or other models, `--unload-after 15` loads
them only when a phone connects and frees the card after 15 minutes with no
phone connected. The phone hears back at once, and the first words come a
few seconds late while the models load. Testing the connection from the
phone starts the loading too. If the card is too full to load them, that
phone uses its own model for the session, and the next one tries again.

Each connection is logged with what it was for (`check` when the phone only
tests that the server is there, `captions` when it streams, `report` when it
sends a diagnostics report to keep in `reports/`) and the app build
that made it, and ends with a summary: minutes of audio, lines written, and
how long a finished line took. Measurements on the same card make live lines
lag by many seconds, so run them only when the log shows no captions session.

The first start downloads the model (about 1.6 GB, 3 GB more for the full one). After that
it starts from the copy on disk without going online: with the internet down and the home
network up, asking Hugging Face first kept it from starting for 4.5 minutes, now 2.5 seconds.
A newer version of a model is not fetched by itself; deleting its `models--...` folder
(under `C:\ozen\hf\hub` on Windows, `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` on Linux) gets the newest at
the next start.
The pairing code goes into the phone: Settings, Transcription engine, Home computer.

### Starting with the computer

The Windows setup registers a task that starts the server with Windows.
On Linux, a systemd user service does the same. Save this as
`~/.config/systemd/user/ozen-server.service` (leave out `--final-model` on
a card under 8 GB):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Ozen home server

[Service]
ExecStart=%h/ozen-server/run.sh --final-model ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-ct2
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now ozen-server
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

The last line starts it at boot, before anyone signs in. Its log:
`journalctl --user -u ozen-server`.

## Pairing the phone

Both setup scripts end by making `pairing.html` next to the server: a QR code
with the address and code in it. Open the iPhone's Camera, point it at the
code, tap the Ozen link, and confirm. To make it again, or for a different
address: `python pairing.py --address wss://<computer>.<tailnet>.ts.net`.

## Reaching it from the phone

- **Same Wi-Fi:** the computer's address, for example `192.168.1.20`. The
  Windows setup lets the phone through the firewall; on Linux with a
  firewall on (ufw is, on some distributions), let it in from the home
  network: `sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8765 proto tcp`
  (your network's own range in place of `192.168.1.0/24`). Tailscale
  Funnel needs no rule: it reaches the server from the computer itself.
- **From anywhere, no app on the phone:** Tailscale Funnel gives the
  server a public `wss://` address with a real certificate:
  `tailscale funnel --bg 8765` (on Windows, in the Windows command prompt;
  WSL's port shows up on Windows' own localhost), then enter
  `wss://<computer>.<tailnet>.ts.net` in the phone. The
  `https://<computer>.<tailnet>.ts.net` that the funnel command prints works
  too; the app turns it into `wss://`. Only someone with the pairing code
  gets captions.

## Starting it with Windows

In the Windows command prompt, once:

```
schtasks /Create /TN "Ozen server" /SC ONLOGON /TR "wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -- bash -lc ~/ozen-server/run.sh"
```

It starts when you log in to Windows and stops when you log out.

## Checking it

```
cd ~/ozen-server && venv/bin/python try_server.py ws://localhost:8765 "$(cat pairing-code)" some-hebrew-16k.wav
```

plays the recording to the server in real time, the way the phone sends
it, and prints each finished line and how long after it was said it
arrived. Give it a text file with what is said in the recording as a
fourth argument and it also prints the share of words it got wrong
(punctuation doesn't count).
