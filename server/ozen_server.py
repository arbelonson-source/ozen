"""Ozen home server: live Hebrew captions from a GPU on the home network.

The phone streams its microphone here as 16 kHz mono PCM16 over one
WebSocket and gets back the words as they form, then the final line for
each utterance. The rules mirror the phone's own Whisper engine
(Sources/OzenPlatform/WhisperKitEngine.swift) so a line looks the same
whichever does the work: speech detection decides where an utterance
starts and ends, a 0.7 s pause ends it, 28 s is the most one pass hears
(cut at the quietest moment of the last 2 s), and while someone is still
talking the utterance is decoded again every `live_interval` seconds.
A GPU makes those passes fast enough to run far more often than a
phone can, and leaves room for what the phone can't afford.

  `end_s` is where in the session's audio the pass ended, in seconds, so
  a client can measure how long after the words were said they arrived.
  `segments` is every piece of the pass with Whisper's own numbers, so the
  phone can run its hallucination checks (WhisperResultFilter) on them.
